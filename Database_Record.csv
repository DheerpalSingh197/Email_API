We're announcing our customizable template system that enables you to build parameterized templates to get started on your next project more easily than before. When you visit the IDX dashboard, you'll see a list of project types that have customized UI for creating a customized project. These themselves are templates.

The same system we use for building our official templates is now available for all developers. Every template can be opened through a link, making them a perfect fit for:

• Reproducing problems in GitHub issues

• Contributing to open source projects

• Running Conference workshops

• Enhancing code tutorials

With one click, a user can have a customized version of a project up and running without worrying about what version of Node.js or what version of a CLI they need to download. Templates take in a set of configuration and user input, and from that user input you create a customized project.

Templates are incredibly powerful and customizable. To show all the things you can do with templates, we open sourced our Official Templates <https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5qsDyh60iU1j3z6uXnfVjYD-WLgnmlItc7rg3LAPC6HpoLJi9RfG3U98MJUpmxfIYw3ZaJWiQapDe5FkolwgzjMCpqbrGvd5WAxdRUuxNEZ5LdsYH2tMrPxTf_jNlW3sQXVblbbufQRBsh0OO6er05DTyfCVINDfsaN0Gjyh5KhIegEyd2ipgxR_0o1DLR-W_OksXs3xloAeQV6-PPIayYshg0bUxlJdhjG8MfR32WroWvuyawO3ZDROXQ> as well as a repository for Community Templates <https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5oCQ_nWVB5XfVJvcVSO7dpWcmc5FxcfFgeavMT4ijcVrumvLfDAe3rMTbC6Fvbt9aD89bWIvIcf2Kg_eTZY78KfwuKUYY_29jCouiK6VNMsMVdiAtb8b07B9yetE-T7NFUQ3mldidtB4GYJIQKKMju4jfZ0RkgYtzMQq8MHSgLLXm1vlwbZfFghPXa-p96oZJE6gETR37u7J5q7AGbtDRaHhRt-q_2x4qLCT47_0ZpGiDMAJjAl_pUMGpdCWJyrgkvYClaCok4>.
